# SSH-Automation-Tool
Quick tool to automate some ssh tasks.

This tool was designed to annoy colleagues.
It can be used as a one-line scripting tool for routers or alternatively perform certain actions on RouterOS units. 
Most of the commands are related to security. (firewalls, port knockers, service restrictions etc.) 

This version comes with amazing soundtrack & annoying backgrounds. 

Note: 
I am not a python expert and this code will probably make some people's eyes bleed. 
Yes I know I used global completely incorrectly, yes I know it is not pythonic. 

To get the code working, either insert your own images and sounds or remove entirely from code.
